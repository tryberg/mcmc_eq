This synthetic example is an idealized stratovolcano monitoring network, based on Mount Hood, Oregon, USA

summit at the center
zmax is next node above highest station

0.1 s std random pick noise added
0.15 s std random station correction added + 0.1 s std random variation to corrections
vp/vs = 1.73 used
Vp model is generic stratovolcano model from Pesicek & Ryberg (2024)
